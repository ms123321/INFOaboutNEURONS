Sure! Here is the in-depth description of the muscle movements and nerve firings involved in producing the vowels "o," "u," and "y":

"o": To produce the vowel "o," the following sequence of muscle movements and nerve firings occur:
The brain sends a signal to the motor neurons that control the muscles of the larynx, causing the vocal folds to adduct and vibrate.
The pharyngeal constrictor muscles contract, narrowing the pharynx and raising the larynx to create a higher pitch.
The tongue moves towards the back of the mouth, with the back of the tongue raised towards the soft palate to create a medium-sized oral cavity and medium frequency resonance.
The lips are rounded and protruded.
The diaphragm and chest wall muscles contract and expand to control airflow.
The specific muscles involved in the production of the vowel "o" include the thyroarytenoid muscles, which control vocal fold adduction; the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, which control pharyngeal constriction; the tongue muscles, including the genioglossus, styloglossus, and hyoglossus muscles, which control tongue position and movement; the orbicularis oris muscle, which controls lip rounding and protrusion; and the diaphragm and chest wall muscles, which control respiration.

"u": To produce the vowel "u," the following sequence of muscle movements and nerve firings occur:
The brain sends a signal to the motor neurons that control the muscles of the larynx, causing the vocal folds to adduct and vibrate.
The pharyngeal constrictor muscles contract, narrowing the pharynx and raising the larynx to create a higher pitch.
The tongue moves towards the back of the mouth, with the back of the tongue raised towards the soft palate to create a small oral cavity and high frequency resonance.
The lips are rounded and protruded.
The diaphragm and chest wall muscles contract and expand to control airflow.
The specific muscles involved in the production of the vowel "u" include the thyroarytenoid muscles, which control vocal fold adduction; the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, which control pharyngeal constriction; the tongue muscles, including the genioglossus, styloglossus, and hyoglossus muscles, which control tongue position and movement; the orbicularis oris muscle, which controls lip rounding and protrusion; and the diaphragm and chest wall muscles, which control respiration.

"y": To produce the vowel "y," the following sequence of muscle movements and nerve firings occur:
The brain sends a signal to the motor neurons that control the muscles of the larynx, causing the vocal folds to adduct and vibrate.
The pharyngeal constrictor muscles contract, narrowing the pharynx and raising the larynx to create a higher pitch.
The tongue moves towards the back of the mouth, with the back of the tongue raised towards the soft palate to create a small oral cavity and high frequency resonance.
The lips are rounded and slightly protruded.
The diaphragm and chest wall muscles contract and expand to control airflow.
The specific muscles involved in the production of the vowel "y" include the thyroarytenoid muscles, which control vocal fold adduction; the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, which control pharyngeal constriction; the tongue muscles, including the genioglossus, styloglossus, and hyoglossus muscles, which control tongue position and movement; the orbicularis oris muscle, which orbicularis oris muscle, which controls lip rounding and protrusion; and the diaphragm and chest wall muscles, which control respiration





Make these more adcanced - get the correct sequence ask chargpt again for correct sequence . Do the constants . Try get the exact correct sequence .



Then try to make a word and use correct sequence



Link into equations using induction current and the recruitment of muscle fibers and force too



And you solve the system
