Sure, I can provide the mathematical equations involved in nerve conduction and the induction of current in a nerve using electromagnetic fields.

The cable equation is a partial differential equation that describes the propagation of electrical signals along a nerve fiber:

∂V/∂t = (1/RmCm) * d/dx (Ri * dV/dx) + Iinj/Cm

Where: V is the transmembrane potential Rm is the membrane resistance Cm is the membrane capacitance Ri is the internal resistance Iinj is the injected current

This equation describes how the transmembrane potential V changes over time and distance along the nerve fiber.

The Hodgkin-Huxley equations describe the ionic currents involved in the generation of an action potential:

Iion = g * (V - Eion)

Where: Iion is the ionic current g is the conductance V is the transmembrane potential Eion is the equilibrium potential of the ion

The Nernst equation can be used to calculate the equilibrium potential of an ion across the nerve membrane:

Eion = (RT/zF) * ln([ion]out/[ion]in)

Where: R is the gas constant T is the absolute temperature z is the valence of the ion F is Faraday's constant [ion]out is the concentration of the ion outside the cell [ion]in is the concentration of the ion inside the cell

To induce a current in a nerve using an electromagnetic field, Maxwell's equation and the law of induction can be used:

∇ x E = - dB/dt

Where: E is the electric field B is the magnetic field

This equation describes how a changing magnetic field dB/dt induces an electric field E.

Finally, the induced current I can be calculated using Ohm's law:

I = E/R

Where: I is the induced current E is the electric field R is the resistance of the nerve tissue

Overall, the mathematical equations involved in nerve conduction and the induction of current in a nerve are complex and involve multiple variables and differential equations.

Use faraday law of induction to calculate induced current not ohms

Sure, I apologize for my previous response. Here is how Faraday's law of induction can be used to calculate the induced current in a nerve due to an electromagnetic field:

Faraday's law of induction states that a changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor, given by:

EMF = - dΦ/dt

Where: EMF is the induced electromotive force Φ is the magnetic flux

In the case of a nerve exposed to an electromagnetic field, the changing magnetic field will induce an EMF in the nerve due to the Faraday's law of induction. This induced EMF will cause a current to flow in the nerve.

The induced current can be calculated using the induced EMF and the total resistance of the nerve, given by:

I = EMF / R_total

Where: I is the induced current R_total is the total resistance of the nerve

However, calculating the total resistance of the nerve is challenging due to its complex structure and variable properties along its length.

Alternatively, we can use a simplified model where the nerve is modeled as a cylindrical conductor with uniform resistivity, radius, and length. In this case, the total resistance R_total of the nerve can be calculated using the formula:

R_total = ρ * (L / (π * r^2))

Where: ρ is the resistivity of the nerve L is the length of the nerve r is the radius of the nerve

Then, the induced current can be calculated using:

I = - (π * r^2 * dΦ/dt) / (ρ * L)

Where: I is the induced current r is the radius of the nerve dΦ/dt is the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the nerve ρ is the resistivity of the nerve L is the length of the nerve

Note that the negative sign indicates that the induced current flows in the opposite direction to the changing magnetic field that induces it.

Overall, the induced current in a nerve due to an electromagnetic field can be calculated using Faraday's law of induction, the total resistance of the nerve, and the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the nerve.
